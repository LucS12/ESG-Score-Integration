# Bloomberg ESG Data:

Files containing ESG data gathered for each pillar (Environmental, Social, Governance) for all Nasdaq Composite Index members are shown separately as generated from the use of Bloomberg's API in Python. They are to be used to identify useful fields for specific sectors/industries to then narrow them down for the calculation of ESG scores.
